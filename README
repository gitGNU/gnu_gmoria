This is the source for gmoria 5.7.1, a dungeon exploration game.  This
is based on Umoria 5.7, which itself was based James Wilson's second major 
release of the game.  

I consider these to be production sources.  Some minor bugs must surely remain,
but there should be no major program bugs encountered.

gmoria 5.x does not understand Umoria 4.87 savefiles.  The changes to the
game are so great, that supporting the old savefile format is not worth
the effort.

This version of the software is different than Umoria 5.7 in the following ways:

1. PDF and HTML manuals are included in texinfo format.
2. A data file defines what monsters are in the game.
3. A data file defines what items are in the game.
4. A data file defines what races and classes are in the game.
5. Some of Lars Helgeland's unofficial patches from http://www.oocities.org/lhelgeland/umoria.html are included:
  a. auto haggling. 
  b. lost items feedback (e.g. which item was disenchanted)
  c. buy/sell any number (e.g. sell 4 torches in a store)
  d. cancel Word of Recall spell (e.g. a tension leaves the air around you)
6. Support for other operating systems is dropped.  Only GNU+Linux is targeted.
gmoria uses gnulib which targets many operating systems, and ncurses is everywhere.
7. Fixed to work with the `script' and `scriptreplay' commands.
8. The hours file has been nixed.  Moria can be played at all times on any day.
9. Increased the maximum number of classes from 8 to 32.
10. Increased the maximum number of spells from 32 to 2^32-2.  This changes the save-game format.
11. Increased the maximum number of scroll, wand and staff effects to from 32 per TVAL to 2^32-1.  TV_SCROLL2 has disappeared.  The opportunity for multiple simultaneous effects has disappeared for these TVALs (but none had multiple simultaneous effects anyway, like potions and food have).
12. Added new "resist poison gas" spell and prayer to Mages and Priests.  It confers a permanent & small resistance to poison gas on the character.  This is meant to offset the threat of a gas attack by an Ancient Multi-Hued dragon by enough to make it a little more fair (e.g. not as many insta-deaths).  The resistance is damage / 1.5.  This changes the save-game format.
13. Added class titles for female characters.


To build this software from the tarball you need the following:

Libraries:
  a curses library (like ncurses)

For the build system:
  make
  yacc

For the man page:
  help2man

For the manual:
  makeinfo (texinfo package on fedora, and ubuntu)
  texi2dvi (texinfo-tex package on fedora, and texinfo package on ubuntu)


The build sequence is in this order:

1. ./bootstrap [gets gnulib]
2. ./configure 
3. make [builds the monster compiler, treasure compiler, and then the game]
4. sudo make install

To run bootstrap, git is required.


To run with script, use the command:
$ script -c /usr/local/bin/moria --timing=timing-file typescript-file
and then to replay it:
$ scriptreplay -t timing-file typescript-file
